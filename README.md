## SQL | In-Depth Exploration

### Overview

This project delves into a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 data using SQL, emphasizing advanced querying techniques. The goal is to provide a thorough exploration of key metrics, creating organized views for data storage, and generating insights to understand the global impact of the pandemic.

### Key Features

- **In-Depth SQL Analysis:**
  - Conducted a detailed analysis of COVID-19 data utilizing various SQL skills, including joins, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), temporary tables, window functions, and aggregate functions.

- **Data Organization and Views:**
  - Created views to store and organize data effectively, facilitating seamless integration with future visualization tools.

- **Key Metric Investigation:**
  - Explored crucial metrics such as total cases vs. total deaths, death percentages, and population infection rates.

- **Ranking of Countries:**
  - Identified and ranked countries based on infection rates and death counts per population.

- **Vaccination Statistics:**
  - Utilized window functions to calculate rolling vaccination statistics and created a dedicated view for easy data retrieval.

### How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
